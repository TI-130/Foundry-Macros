# Foundry-Macros

Simple Macros designed for use with FXMaster, The Furnace (Advanced Macros) and MIDI-QOL Modules in Foundry VTT. I'm hardly the original author of all these, only tweaked for use with Midi-QOL. The scaling effects are designed with the assumption that the scene has 100 px grid squares. If the grid is set close to that scale it should be fine, other than scaling strange at very close range. Otherwise something may go wonky if you are far off from a 100 px grid.

As written they are designed for use with the On-Use Macro function for spells/items as part of Midi-QOL, and leverage FXMaster to play the spell animations. These are works of the Foundry VTT community that I have compiled and tweaked, and were created to leverage spell animations from modules/creators like JB2A. Using the "On-Use" macro field from Midi-QOL, the macro will execute when DAMAGE is rolled. If you have speed rolls active and always roll damage, it will play everytime.

Special thanks to Lazytron and MagoRaion on the JB2A discord for compiling and testing the bulk of these codes.

Works in progress, and I'm certain they can be coded more elegantly. We are learning javascript on the fly.
