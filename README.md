# Foundry-Macros

NOTE: Files in the sub-folder structure are using updated codes. All macros will be able to target any number of targets, and some contain code to randomize the files pulled for playing the animation.

Simple Macros designed for use with FXMaster and MIDI-QOL Modules in Foundry VTT, and some for Token Magic Effects application. Some of these are not mine, I've just scavenged and modified others code work. Scaling could use some tweaks, but they'll play nice on most normal grid sizes in Foundry VTT. 

As written they are designed for use with the On-Use Macro function for spells/items as part of Midi-QOL (or use with the Item Macro module), and leverage FXMaster to play the spell animations. These are works of the Foundry VTT community that I have compiled and tweaked, and were created to leverage spell animations from modules/creators like JB2A. Using the "On-Use" macro field from Midi-QOL, the macro will execute when DAMAGE is rolled. If you have speed rolls active and always roll damage, it will play everytime.

Special thanks to Lazytron and MagoRaion on the JB2A discord for compiling and testing the bulk of these codes and Kandashi for offering guidance on how to clean up the messy code.
