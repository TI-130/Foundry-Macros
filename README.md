# Foundry-Macros

Simple Macros designed for use with FXMaster and MIDI-QOL Modules in Foundry VTT. I'm hardly the author of these, only tweaked for use with Midi-QOL.

As they stand they are designed for use with On-Use Macro function for spells/items as part of Midi-QOL, and levereage FXMaster to play the spell animations. These are works of the Foundry VTT community that I have compiled and tweaked, and were created to leverage spell animations from modules/creators like JB2A.

Special thanks to Lazytron and MagoRaion on the JB2A discord for compiling and testing the bulk of these codes.

Works in progress, and I'm certain they can be coded more elegantly. We are learning javascript on the fly.
