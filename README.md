# Foundry-Macros

Simple Macros designed for use with FXMaster, The Furnace (Advanced Macros) and MIDI-QOL Modules in Foundry VTT. I'm hardly the author of these, only tweaked for use with Midi-QOL. The scaling effects are designed with the assumption that the scene has 100 px grid squares. If yours are different, they may require some tweaks.

As written they are designed for use with the On-Use Macro function for spells/items as part of Midi-QOL, and leverage FXMaster to play the spell animations. These are works of the Foundry VTT community that I have compiled and tweaked, and were created to leverage spell animations from modules/creators like JB2A.

Special thanks to Lazytron and MagoRaion on the JB2A discord for compiling and testing the bulk of these codes.

Works in progress, and I'm certain they can be coded more elegantly. We are learning javascript on the fly.
